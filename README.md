# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI
## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

## Learnt things from this Project

- By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and clear filter button in the dashboard was achieved using bookmarks and selection.
- Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard 

## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

## Insights and suggestions:
- ADR Remains Stable
Upon analyzing the dashboard, it’s evident that the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for AtliQ Hotels has remained relatively stable over the given time frame. This stability in pricing indicates a consistent pricing strategy.

-Notably, AtliQ Hotels currently do not employ dynamic pricing based on weekdays and weekends. This presents an opportunity to consider adjusting the pricing strategy. Dynamic pricing can help optimize revenue by offering different rates for weekdays and weekends, aligning pricing more closely with demand fluctuations.

-This insight suggests that exploring dynamic pricing strategies could be a valuable initiative to consider, potentially leading to increased revenue and better revenue management.

## Overall Occupancy Rate
-The overall occupancy rate for AtliQ Grands’ properties currently stands at a solid 57%. This figure reflects the percentage of available rooms that are being utilized by guests. A 57% occupancy rate indicates a substantial portion of rooms are booked, contributing positively to revenue.

-Maintaining a healthy occupancy rate is crucial for optimizing revenue and resource management. This insight suggests that AtliQ Grands has been successful in attracting guests and efficiently filling available rooms.

-As part of ongoing strategies, it may be worthwhile to explore avenues to further increase occupancy, especially during off-peak periods, to maximize revenue potential.

-Overall, the 57% occupancy rate provides a foundational understanding of AtliQ Grands’ performance and can serve as a basis for further revenue optimization efforts.

## Average Rating
-The average guest rating for AtliQ Grands’ properties is a commendable 3.62. This rating, derived from guest reviews and surveys, reflects the overall satisfaction of guests who have experienced our hospitality.

-A rating of 3.62 signifies a positive guest experience, with the majority of guests expressing satisfaction with their stays. Guest ratings are a vital indicator of our service quality and the guest experience we provide.

-As we continue to prioritize guest satisfaction, it’s important to maintain and improve upon this rating. By consistently delivering exceptional service, addressing guest feedback, and enhancing guest experiences, we can aim for even higher ratings in the future.

-The 3.62 average rating underscores our commitment to offering outstanding hospitality and ensuring our guests have memorable stays.

When the hotel is sorted by its occupancy rate, we observe a relationship that exists between ratings and occupancy. Consequently, we recommend examining the reviews provided by customers on all booking platforms, addressing and resolving any issues raised by them.

-As we can see realisation% and ADR trends by booking platform remained similar and the average difference of $150. we checked the weeks, the trend has no significant difference. Even direct offline and direct online have similar realization and ADR. offering coupons and cashback incentives directly to customers who book rooms through the hotel’s website or offline at checkout can be an effective strategy to increase revenue realization, even without discouraging the use of third-party booking platforms. “realization” in the context of the hospitality industry, refers to the percentage of revenue retained after accounting for cancellations and no-shows.
